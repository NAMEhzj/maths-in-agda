Mathematics in Agda

I am trying to implement as many mathematical concepts in Agda as i can. Originally, I wanted to start more abstractly, but for now I've concentrated on VectorSpaces...

Work is still massively in progress, I have not looked into some of the older modules in months and the newer ones aren't very clean/pretty/commented either, but once I find a structure I am happy with i might clean up the library a bit. For now I'm just playing around, testing what I can do and what I can't.

update 24.05.2019: I have put a bit of structure into the whole project, made a library out of it and worked a little bit on Groups.

update 19.06.2019: I have actually made a local git repository and a new one on github, and will now delete the old one
